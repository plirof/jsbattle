# Simulation

Simulation is based on two independent loops: rendering and simulation. Simulation loop updates model of the battle while rendering loop reads a state of the model and visualize it. Keeping them independent allows avoiding unwanted interferences. It is also possible to easily replace rendering layer or even turn it completely off.

Before model and view can be started, the `Simulation` object must be properly initialised. Following diagram shows details of initialisation and loop calls:
