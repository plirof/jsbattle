# UBD files
Ultimate Battle Descriptor (UBD) contains all the information required to replay a battle. Battle launched from UBD file is deterministic and always has the same outcome.

## UBD Player

You can run as any shell command (`./ubdplayer.js`) or via NodeJs (`node ubdplayer.js`). For more information, run `./ubdplayer.js --help`.
